Motivation
Common LaTeX resume-builders such as moderncv and the friggeri-cv look great if you're looking for a multi-page resume with numerous citations, but usually imperfect for making a thorough, single-page one. A lot of companies today search resumes based on keywords but at the same time require/prefer a one-page or two-page resume.

This template attempts to look clean, highlight details, be a single page, and allow useful LaTeX templating.
